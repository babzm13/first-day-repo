            <p>My name is Barbara. I am femme-presenting gender-fluid, and prefer "they/them" pronouns, although any will do! I'm really not picky! :) I am an avid LARPer and enjoy playing cooperateive board games.</p>
            <p>I own two LARPing organizations: Refuge LARP Portland and Pulsar Experiences. These organizations are my pride and joy. I love being able to support local LARPing, and give creative outlets to people in the Pacific Northwest. I'm also the head of plot for one of the teams in Refuge LARP Portland, which means I am in charge of managing a team of writers who develop the stories that we run in the game. It is a fun and enjoyable hobby, and I love to talk about it, so feel free to ask!</p>
